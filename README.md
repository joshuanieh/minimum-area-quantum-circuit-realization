# minimum-area-quantum-circuit-realization
The code is based on Quantum Boolean Circuits for Quantum Computing and Communications, a paper presented by I-Ming Tsai with the advisor Sy-Yen Kuo in 2002 at NTU.
It's just the first version and I will find out whether there are some unexpected bugs and make the codes more readable and beautiful in the summer vacation.
